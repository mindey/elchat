# Earthlang Font

It simply adds extra CSS to web chats to enable people to practise Earth language ([https://earthlanguage.org](https://earthlanguage.org)) font.

You can currently use with Freenode's IRC chat at [https://webchat.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net) with ([Kiwi](https://kiwiirc.com) webclient).

Once installed, the default CSS is overridden, and fonts are added from [https://earthlanguage.org/ELfont-ascii.htm](https://earthlanguage.org/ELfont-ascii.htm) to places that support chat, like chat window and nicknames.

This extension is made starting with:
- [https://css-tricks.com/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension/](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension/) template.
- [https://font-converter.net](https://www.font-converter.net/en/download/0a5c3a5b05052f5c82c03687bfa5b509) was used to convert font from ttf.

Thank you to Jo Chen, Tomotake Fujita, Mr. Mitsuhiro Saiji and Yoshiko McFarland for creating the font and the language.

The font is used for language learning purposes, and full credit is due to the creators. Please, contact `mindey@mindey.com` for any inquiries.
